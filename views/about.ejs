      <h1>About MEAN Stack Jobs</h1>
      <section>
          <p>
              Circa 2014, I started the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Austin-MEAN-Stack-Development/' target='_blank'>Austin MEAN Stack Dev meetup and user group</a>, within which I was able to meet lots of great people, including developers, hiring managers, and recruiters alike.  It turned out that some of the developers were not only there to learn about the MEAN Stack, they were also there looking to network in hopes of landing their next development opportunity!  
          </p>

          <p>
              Recruiters and hiring managers started asking about spreading the word about their open positions through my meetup/user group...and so, I did.  Lo and behold, we landed a few nice opportunities ending in direct hires.  Cool!
          </p>

          <p>
              Although something cool was happening, I could not put my finger on it.  Finally, I discovered a little niche that was the root of these successful placements via my network and site.
          </p>

              So, now here we are, and I put up this web site to facilitate this vantage point.  I hope you find it useful.

            PS: It's a forgone conclusion that any web site is a work in progress, but there are still levels and phases, and this site is at at phase -100.  Please bear with me as I update and enhance it.  Alas, the diamond in this rough is not the site ;-)
